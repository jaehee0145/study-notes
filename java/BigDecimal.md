## BigDecimal in Java

<br>

> *** *BigDecimal* represents an immutable arbitrary-precision decimal number.** It consists of two parts:
>
> - Unscaled value - an arbitrary precision integer
> - scale - a 32-bit integer representing the number of digits to the right of the decimal point
> For example, the BigDecimal 3.14 has the unscaled value of 314 and the scale of 2.
> **We use *BigDecimal* for high-precision arithmetic. We also use it for calculations requiring control over scale and rounding off behavior.** One such example is calculations involving financial transactions.
